4 phases for this npm react project : PREP , DEV , TEST , PROD
DEV phase
==================================================================================================================
Now that we have our code. Lets run it and see what we get
Contents will be same as previous projects.
    #vim dockerfile.dev
    #docker build -t betzdockz/myreact_app-dev -f dockerfile.dev ./
    #docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --name react_app-dev betzdockz/myreact_app-dev
When docker builds this image,
package.json lists the dependency needed, and npm install would use it.
This step creates the node_modules dir and its contents. node_modules takes up 99% project storage. 
    #rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    #docker build -t betzdockz/myreact_app-dev -f dockerfile.dev ./
    #docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --name react_app-dev betzdockz/myreact_app-dev
On browser check http://loclhost:3000/

Slow dev :  Lets make changes. Edit the src/App.js file. Add more <p> blocks
            To see the change, you would need to repeat docker build and docker run each time.
Fast dev :  Bind Mount can be setup to mirror laptop local files into docker.
            This makes you faster by just having to switch between VScode and browser. skip running and waiting in bash.
            Bind mount can be done with --mount flag or --volume/-v
            Since this excercise was done on Windows, WATCHPACK_POLLING=true need to set in a .env within react_project
    #docker run --mount type=bind,src=<host-path>,dst=<container-path>          #Syntax
    #docker run --volume <host-path>:<container-path>                           #Syntax
Since this excercise was done in Windows you would have to troubleshoot the path formatting. The below command worked
    #docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -v "//c/Users/beths/OneDrive/Documents/learndocker/react_project":/opt/react_project --name react_app-dev betzdockz/myreact_app-dev
If you are doing this excercise in Linux, hopefully the command is simpler as below
    #docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):$(pwd) --name react_app-dev betzdockz/myreact_app-dev
You will get a run failure.
This is because node_modules directory, which was present in the myreact_app-dev image, gets deleted when you perform volume binding.
Docker volumes will allow any data to persist a docker stop, docker rm, and volume mounting (mount binding). 
Lets create a volume for node_modules
    #docker volume create node_modules          # This can be skipped as docker run can create volumes along with container
    #docker volume ls
Now we map the path /opt/react_project/node_modules to this volume using docker run
    #docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -v node_modules:/opt/react_project/node_modules -v "//c/Users/beths/OneDrive/Documents/learndocker/react_project":/opt/react_project --name react_app-dev betzdockz/myreact_app-dev
Now modify <p> blocks in src/App.js, save it and browser will reflect.
We can convert this long docker run to docker-compose.yml
    #vim docker-compose.yml
    ->services: dev: build: context: ./
    ->services: dev: build: dockerfile: dockerfile.dev
    ->services: dev: volumes: - ./:/opt/react_project
                              - node_modules:/opt/react_project/node_modules
    ->volumes: node_modules: external: true
build context specifies the path of all items needed by dockerfile.dev. dockerfile.dev is also specified as it is not default name
The volumes under services specifies all the volume for mounting and persistant volume. 
The volumes block specifies the volume to be used by docker-compose. 
-Exclude "external: true" to allow the 1st docker-compose up to create react_project-node_modules. All subsequent docker compose will reuse volume.
-Include "external: true" in senario where there exists content in node_modules to be reused prior to creating docker-compose.yml
node_modules could be made persistant by using anonymous volumes. Here docker will name the volume using hash code
    ->services: dev: volumes: - ./:/opt/react_project
                              - /opt/react_project/node_modules
with anonymous volumes, you can skip the entire volumes: block (L81 above) in docker-compose.yml.
but this would allow for duplication or same content, and would risk getting deleted by the admins.
    #docker-compose config
This command verifies your docker-compose file
    #docker-compose up
    #docker-compose down
