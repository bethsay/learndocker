Dockerfile is the configuration of our containers. Name must be "Dockerfile" with no extensions
    #vim Dockerfile
In the Dockerfile, specify base-image + run installation of dependencies + startup-commands
    #FROM <base-image>
    #RUN <command to install dependencies>
    #CMD <startup command>
Copy the sample mydockerfiles/Dockerfile_redis as Dockerfile and build it
    #docker build .
On Linux you may see the imageid at the end of the output
    # docker run <image-id>
On Windows Docker Desktop, cli will return build-id at the end. We cant use it with docker run
Check the GUI build page and image page. Copy the imageid and do docker run with it.
    # docker run <image-id>
At each command in the Dockerfile,
    Docker runs a temp container 
        using the temp image from output of previous command (Exception for for first command ie FROM)
        and creates temp image using the command/parameters to be run as a temp container for next command (Exception for last command ie CMD)
