# learndocker
Contains notes and files while i figure out docker

The commit history looks like a mess.
As i have lost files that had unfinished work, i would like the repo to keep drafts and WIP content as well.

Migration requirements:
- commits that modify published files must be limited to a single file
- commits can have multiple files only if all are new files.
- commits should be made only to branches.
- learning branch to hold drafts and recieve commits.
- main branch to hold finished docs.
- main branch gets updated only with cherrypick or pull request 

After data is complete, maybe convert text files to markdown.
