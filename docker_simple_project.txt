We sill run a nodejs webpage displaying any text.
If it wasnt for docker you will have to install nodejs on your laptop and every host that you want to test or run your webpage.
For this project dev need package.json to define dependencies and index.js for webpage content. Check simple_project folder
Create dockerfile in project folder to fetch compatabile image + copy web files into container FS + RUN webpage
    #docker build -t betzdockz/mynpmwebpage .
    #docker run betzdockz/mynpmwebpage
The webpage is listening on 8080 and should be accessible in browser when you call localhost:8080.
But the host machine is not aware of it.
Perform port mapping to connect some hostport to containerport with -p
    #docker run -p 323232:8080 betzdockz/mynpmwebpage
Now check browser with localhost:8080.
Anytime we make any change in index.js, or package.js or Dockerfile, we should
    #docker build -t betzdockz/mynpmwebpage .
    #docker run -p 323232:<app.listen.port> betzdockz/mynpmwebpage
Practice by modifying the app.get and app.listen in index.js file
